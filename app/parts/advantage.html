          Every Brella plan comes with a benefit for Moderate, Severe, and
          Catastrophic conditions. Employees can select the payout amounts that
          fit their needs and their budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employers can fund part or all of the premiumsâ€”or offer Brella as a
          voluntary benefit. The choice is up to you.
